        "Robot navigation has long been a core focus of artificial intelligence research, for valid reasons. At first glance, enabling a machine to autonomously travel from one point or node to another may appear straightforward; but in practice however it is far from trivial. Robot navigation requires a system to interpret its environment, reason about spatial relationships, and commit to a sequence of actions that avoids potential hazards and unnecessary inefficiencies. These challenges become significantly more complex once robots move beyond controlled laboratory conditions and operate in real-world environments. Settings such as hospitals, warehouses, road networks, and mountainous regions introduce dynamic constraints that AI systems must handle and address in real time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robot navigation particularly compelling due to the wide range of artificial intelligence subfields it draws together. Path planning alone often relies on classical search algorithms. While Perception introduces techniques from computer vision and sensor fusion. Dealing with uncertainty pushes systems towards probabilistic reasoning. With machine learning playing an increasingly pivotal role in state estimation, predictions, and adaptive decision making. This combination has broadened the concept of robot navigation as a whole; it has become less about a single algorithm and more about how different techniques interact in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most established approaches to robot navigation is the use of search algorithms. In this framework, the environment is modelled as a graph, with locations represented as nodes and possible movements as edges between them. As discussed by Russel and Norvig (2021), several foundational techniques fall under this category, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search, and A*. While BFS and DFS are effective for systematically exploring graph structures, they are limited to when applied to real-world navigation problems, as neither account for physical distance, energy consumption, potential risk, which is crucial in real world scenarios. A* overcomes and solves some of these shortcomings by incorporating a heuristic that estimates the remaining cost to reach the goal. This allows the algorithm to focus its research on more promising paths rather than exploring the graph blindly. In practice, this ability to balance search efficiency with solution quality is a key reason why A* continues to be widely used in navigation systems today.\n",
        "\n",
        "Search-based navigation is not just an academic idea. It is used extensively in industrial systems where predictability matters. An example found is in Warehouse robotics. Large fulfilment centres rely on fleets of autonomous robots that move items between shelves, sorting stations, and loading areas. These environments are structured, but mistakes are costly. Research by Wurman, D’Andrea, and Mountz (2008) shows how hundreds of robots can be coordinated using graph-based planning techniques. What stands out here is that even with access to modern machine learning tools, designers still rely on classical planners because their behaviour can be analysed and controlled.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, many navigation problems are not static. Real environments change. Sensors introduce noise. Maps are incomplete or outdated. This is where probabilistic navigation methods become important. Techniques such as Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) allow robots to build a map while simultaneously estimating their own position within it. Particle filters and Monte Carlo localisation take this further by maintaining multiple hypotheses about where the robot might be (Russell & Norvig, 2021). Instead of assuming certainty, these methods accept uncertainty as unavoidable. In settings such as hospitals or military operations, this approach is often the only viable option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning has added another layer to navigation, particularly in perception. Neural networks enable robots to process complex sensory data that would be difficult to handle using hand-crafted rules. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for example, are widely used to detect obstacles, classify terrain, and recognise landmarks (Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courville, 2016). In some research, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to navigation tasks, allowing agents to learn movement strategies through trial and error. While these systems can perform well in simulation, their reliance on large datasets and high computational cost raises practical concerns. More importantly, their internal decision-making processes are often difficult to interpret, which limits their use in safety-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because no single approach solves all aspects of navigation, many real systems adopt hybrid designs. Learning-based methods handle perception, while classical algorithms manage planning and control. A robot might use a neural network to interpret sensor data, then apply A* to calculate a safe route. From a practical perspective, this division of labour makes sense. Planning remains structured and explainable, while perception benefits from data-driven flexibility. This combination is now common in deployed systems rather than purely experimental ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Navigation becomes significantly harder in unstructured or hazardous environments. Mountainous regions, disaster zones, and remote rural areas all introduce constraints that structured environments do not. Drones used for search-and-rescue or humanitarian delivery must operate with limited battery life, unreliable GPS signals, and rapidly changing weather. In these scenarios, the shortest route in terms of steps is often not the best route. What matters more is total distance, energy usage, and risk exposure. Search-based planners like A* remain valuable here because they allow costs to be modelled explicitly. This is one of the reasons I focused on navigation in mountainous regions such as Nepal, where route selection has direct consequences for mission success.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robot navigation also plays a critical role in medical environments. Hospital robots tasked with delivering supplies or guiding visitors must move safely around patients and staff. These systems rely heavily on sensor fusion, combining data from cameras, LiDAR, and ultrasonic sensors to maintain awareness of their surroundings. Probabilistic models allow robots to anticipate human movement and adjust their paths accordingly (Li, Y., et al. (2024)). Similar principles apply in warehouse robotics, where multiple agents operate in close proximity and must coordinate movement to avoid congestion.\n",
        "\n",
        "An issue that appears repeatedly across these domains is explainability. As robots operate closer to humans, designers need to understand why a system chose a particular route or action. Deterministic planners such as A* offer an advantage here. Engineers can trace decisions step by step and verify correctness. Learning-based systems, while powerful, often require additional constraints or monitoring to ensure predictable behaviour. This trade-off continues to shape how navigation systems are designed and deployed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, robot navigation illustrates how different AI techniques contribute to solving a single complex problem. Search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and A* provide structure and reliability. Probabilistic methods address uncertainty. Machine learning enhances perception and adaptability. As autonomous systems expand into demanding real-world environments, including mountainous regions where drones support humanitarian efforts, navigation remains an area where careful algorithmic choices matter. For these reasons, robot navigation continues to be both a challenging research problem and a highly relevant applied AI domain.\n",

        "This section compares three classical AI search techniques—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A*—within the context of drone route planning across mountainous regions of Nepal.\n",
        "The purpose of the comparison is not only to describe how each algorithm operates, but to evaluate how suitable each one is when applied to a real navigation problem. I focus on the type of input data each technique requires, the outputs it produces, and how well it handles practical constraints such as distance, efficiency, and safety. This analysis leads to the selection of A* for the prototype implementation in Part C.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Breadth-First Search (BFS):\n",
        "\n",
        "Breadth-First Search is an uninformed search algorithm that explores a graph level by level. It expands all nodes at a given depth before moving deeper into the search space. Because of this behaviour, BFS guarantees that the first solution found uses the smallest possible number of transitions between the start and goal nodes (Russell & Norvig, 2021). From an algorithmic point of view, this makes BFS predictable and easy to reason about.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a drone navigation setting, BFS only requires the basic graph structure as input. Each location must be connected to its neighbouring locations, but no distance values or heuristic information are needed. The output is a sequence of locations representing a valid route with the fewest intermediate waypoints. This simplicity makes BFS straightforward to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "When applied to the Nepal scenario, BFS quickly identifies a short route such as Lukla → Namche Bazaar → Dolpa. At first glance, this appears efficient. Fewer stops suggest faster travel. However, a closer look reveals the main limitation. BFS ignores physical distance entirely. In this case, the segment between Namche Bazaar and Dolpa spans over 120 km, which is impractical for a drone with limited battery capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "BFS also has relatively high memory requirements, as it must store all frontier nodes at each depth. As the navigation graph grows larger, this becomes increasingly inefficient. Overall, BFS is complete and reliable, but its inability to account for distance or cost makes it poorly suited for realistic drone navigation where energy efficiency and safe routing are critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Depth-First Search (DFS):\n",
        "\n",
        "Depth-First Search follows a very different strategy. Instead of exploring level by level, DFS commits to a single path and explores it as deeply as possible before backtracking. This approach makes DFS memory-efficient, since it only stores the current path rather than a full frontier of nodes.\n",
        "Like BFS, DFS requires only the graph structure as input and produces a sequence of locations as output. In some contexts, such as exploratory robots or simple graph traversal tasks, this behaviour can be useful. DFS allows a system to reach deep parts of a search space quickly without significant memory overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, for navigation problems, DFS introduces serious weaknesses. Because it does not consider distance, cost, or heuristics, DFS can easily commit to highly inefficient routes. In the Nepal drone example, DFS may return a path such as Lukla → Muktinath → Gokyo Valley → Manang → Dolpa. This route is significantly longer and less practical than available alternatives.\n",
        "DFS provides no guarantees of optimality, either in terms of distance or number of steps (Russell & Norvig, 2021).\n",
        "\n",
        "In some cases, it may even fail to find a reasonable solution until large portions of the graph have been explored. For drone navigation—where energy constraints, terrain difficulty, and safety are all important—these limitations make DFS unsuitable. In this project, DFS is primarily useful as a baseline to demonstrate how uninformed search performs in geographically constrained environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. A* Search Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "A* is an informed search algorithm that explicitly incorporates cost into its decision-making. It evaluates nodes using the function\n",
        "f(n) = g(n) + h(n),\n",
        "where g(n) represents the cost accumulated so far and h(n) estimates the remaining cost to the goal. When the heuristic is admissible, A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path in terms of total cost (Russell & Norvig, 2021).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike BFS and DFS, A* requires additional input. The navigation graph must include weighted edges representing distances, and a heuristic function must be defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, straight-line distance estimates are used, which is appropriate for geographic navigation. The output produced by A* is a route that minimises total travel distance rather than the number of transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "What stands out in practice is how this affects route quality. In the Nepal case, A* returned a path with more intermediate locations than BFS, but a much shorter total distance—61 km compared to over 130 km. This reflects realistic drone behaviour. A drone does not benefit from fewer waypoints if the overall journey is longer or more energy-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "A* is also widely used in applied navigation systems.\n",
        "For example, structured planning methods similar to A* are employed in industrial robotics, such as warehouse navigation, where reliability and cost optimisation are essential (Wurman, D’Andrea, & Mountz, 2008). Another advantage is interpretability. A*’s decisions can be traced and explained, which is important in safety-critical applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main drawback of A* is its higher computational and memory requirements compared to DFS. Performance also depends on the quality of the heuristic.\n",
        "However, in structured geographic environments with reasonable heuristic estimates, A* consistently outperforms uninformed search strategies.\n",

For example, if the manually constructed graph over-represents well-connected or more populated regions, the system might inadvertently prioritise already advantaged communities while overlooking smaller or remote settlements. In the context of Nepal, where access to resources varies widely across mountainous areas, the choice of nodes and edges included in the network could affect which communities receive timely aid via drones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fairness also relates to how the user interacts with the system. If the interface expects literacy, stable internet access, or technical knowledge, certain groups—such as older residents, rural populations, or those with disabilities—may be unintentionally excluded. Ensuring fairness means designing input methods and interfaces that remain accessible regardless of background, education, or physical ability.\n",

        "Bias may also arise from how the navigation graph is constructed. If the model prioritises major hubs while excluding smaller or remote settlements, routes may systematically favour already well-served regions. In a real deployment, this could disadvantage rural communities that may benefit most from drone-based delivery or assistance.\n",

        "Accessibility also relates to transparency. A clear explanation of how routes are selected (e.g., why A* chooses a longer but safer path) supports users who may lack technical expertise but require confidence in the system’s decisions. Transparent algorithms and visual map outputs help build trust across diverse communities.\n",
